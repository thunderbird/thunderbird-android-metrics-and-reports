So, no footprint in this case for sent messages. I checked this issue in the same TB for Android and 2nd account (different imap server) and no issue like this. </p>",dxtr80;platform34;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;os:TB Android 14.0, Motorola Razr 60 ultra, Android 15;solver_id:7297958",2,0,0,,,

I'd like to provide feedback regarding security concerns regarding the UI specifications of the Android version of Thunderbird. </p><p>Currently, Thunderbird for Android displays the sender's ""display name only"" on the email list screen, making the sender's actual email address invisible at all times. </p><p>I feel this specification increases the following risks, particularly in smartphone environments: </p><p>- Anyone can freely forge display names. - Phishing scams posing as financial institutions, e-commerce sites, and official support are common. - Users often rely on the list screen or notifications to determine the content of emails. </p><p>As a result, a UI that makes it difficult to determine whether an email is from a legitimate sender at the list screen level can become a breeding ground for phishing scams. </p><p>The PC version of Thunderbird allows for detailed header display, etc., and I'm disappointed that the mobile version of Thunderbird, despite being the same Thunderbird, is at a disadvantage in terms of security. </p><p>I would appreciate it if you could consider the following improvements. </p><p>- Setting to always display ""display name + email address"" on the email list screen </p>",pc9801es;platform34;Yu5tiqX9og;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36;os:Android;solver_id:7298627",2,0,0,,,

Type of stuck email varies, some have attachments, some do not. No amount of ""Send all emails"" tapping will send them. I have to send them to my draft folder, then resend them, which they usually go thru.  My laptop does not have this issue as its Thunderbird has NO Outbox. This is VERY FRUSTRATING as I constantly discover emails stuck in Outbox DAYS after I thought they'd been sent. I'm using IMAP and have the correct STMP settings recommended ny Xfinity (<a href=""http://comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">comcast.net</a>) email host.
