Tried all your suggestions without resolution but your suggestions led me to figure out the outbox and occasionally inbox email blocks were most likely due to Web Guard, a sub feature (antivirus) for my Avast Mobile Security app. I never had this problem with my email account thru my desktop or laptop. So I have disabled this Web Guard on my mobile and all seems to work well now. Again, much thanks for being there and taking this on. God bless! </p>",thomas.peeples,false,0,0
